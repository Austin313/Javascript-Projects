    -Todo app;
    -Tictactoe browser game;
    -Calculator;
    -A custom pizza menu;
}

#todo app 
    This creates objects and allows them to be deleted freely. Super basic ToDo app.


#Tictactoe Browser game 
    This one I had a lot of fun on, and getting it to work perfectly and the way I wanted to get it to work. Added Sound effects and custom properties really is pumped me up to move into C++ and C#.


#Calculator 
    This is a fully functional calculator accesible and completed using JS, CSS, HTML. 


Pizza Menu 
    This was a pizza menu, looking sort of into something like I could use in a ecommerce scenario.
